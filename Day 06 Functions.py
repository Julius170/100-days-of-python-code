# CODE BLOCK
# INDENTATONS:
# ARE BASICALLY THE INDENTED STATEMENTS AFTER EVERY FUNCTION
# THE TAB AND SPACE KEY ARE USED IS USED TO CREATE INDENTATIONS
# NOTE: TYPING FOUR SPACES IS MORE RECOMENDED THAN USING THE TAB KEY WHEN WRITTING IN PYTHON
# NOTE TO ALSO AVOID USING BOTH THE (TAB) AND THE (SPACE) AS INDENTATION ON THE SAME PYTHON FILE




# WHILE LOOPS
# CONTINUES TO RUN WHILE THE CONDITION GIVEN IS STILL TRUE

# while something_is_true

    # then do this
    # and do this too
    
    
# FINAL EXERCISE:
